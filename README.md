# VR_Unity3D_Executables

This repository contains public versions of some of the Unity3D executable files that I have been working on and their respective data folders. To use any of these files, double-click on the ___.exe file on a computer with VIVE hardware (head-mounted display and hand-held controllers) and the "game" (everything here is educational) should start automatically.
